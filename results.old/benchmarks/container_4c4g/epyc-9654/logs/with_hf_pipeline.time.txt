Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
Could not find any ONNX files with standard file name decoder_model_merged.onnx, files found: [PosixPath('encoder_model.onnx'), PosixPath('decoder_model.onnx'), PosixPath('decoder_with_past_model.onnx')]. Please make sure to pass a `file_name` and/or `subfolder` argument to `from_pretrained` when loading an ONNX file with non-standard file names.

Due to a bug fix in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/28687 transcription using a multilingual Whisper will default to language detection followed by transcription instead of translation to English.This might be a breaking change for your use case. If you want to instead always translate your audio to English, make sure to pass `language='en'`.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token.As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
