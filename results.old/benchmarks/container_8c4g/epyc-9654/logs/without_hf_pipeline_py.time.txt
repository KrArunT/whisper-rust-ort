Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
You have passed task=transcribe, but also have set `forced_decoder_ids` to [[1, None], [2, 50359]] which creates a conflict. `forced_decoder_ids` will be ignored in favor of task=transcribe.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token.As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
