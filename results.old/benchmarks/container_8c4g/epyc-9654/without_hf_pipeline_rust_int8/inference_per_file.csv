Intrigued, Emma wonders how AI can create something from scratch. Her curiosity grows and she decides to dive deeper into this new technology called generative AI. Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence designed to create new content. artificial intelligence designed to create new content, such as text, images, music, and videos. Unlike traditional AI, which analyzes or categorizes data, generative AI produces original content based on patterns learned from vast data sets. Essentially, it generates new unique material. These models are often trained on large amounts of data and use sophisticated algorithms to mimic human creativity. Tools like ChatGPT or Dolly algorithms to mimic human creativity. Tools like Chat GPT or Dolly can create art, write essays, or simulate conversations by generating outputs based on user prompts. Generative AI has a wide range of applications, content creation. Tools like GPT4 generate text, blog posts, stories, and essays from simple prompts. Art and Design AI models such as Dolly generates unique images and designs based on text descriptions. AI models such as Dali generates unique images and designs based on text descriptions, transforming creativity and art, music and audio. AI can compose music or replicate voices, offering new possibilities for musicians and audio engineers. Healthcare. Generative AI simulates disease progression or creates synthetic medical data, helping doctors gain faster insights for research. Let's take Image Generation as an example to explain how generative AI works. Data collection and learning. AI models like Dolly are trained on large data sets of images paired with text descriptions. These data sets teach the model to recognize different objects, colors, styles, and how to associate text with corresponding images. The more data the AI learns from, the better it can generate accurate and diverse images based on user prompts. When image inputs are prompt like a cat wearing sunglasses, the transformer model processes the text, recognizing words like cat and sunglasses, and links them to images that learn from during training. Transformers help the AI decide how to combine these elements into a coherent image. Tokens and Context The text input, such as a cat, is a very important thing to do. image. Tokens in context. The text input, such as a cat wearing sunglasses, is split into smaller parts called tokens. The AI processes each token and understands their relationship. For instance, it knows the sunglasses should be placed on the cat, creating a contextually accurate image. Feedback mechanism. Generative AI models improved through feedback. After generating an image, users provide feedback on the accuracy or quality of the output. If Emma's generated image shows the sunglasses floating beside the cat, she can mark it as incorrect. The model uses this feedback to improve future image generations. Reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning further enhances the AI's ability. The model is rewarded when it generates accurate images and corrected when it makes mistakes. For example, when Emma describes a sunset and corrected when it makes mistakes. For example, when META describes a sunset and the AI produces a vibrant sunset image, it receives positive reinforcement. Over time, this method refines the model's ability to generate better images. Data science and AI models. Data scientists curate the training data and define the parameters that help the AI generate accurate images. The more varied the dataset, the more versatile the AI becomes in generating diverse types of content. For example, in the might describe a futuristic city-skate, in the AI would produce a unique image based on what it learned. The generated image isn't just a copy of past data, but an entirely new The generated image isn't just a copy of past data but an entirely new creation showcasing the AI's ability to combine learn patterns and creativity. Now let's have a quick fun quiz on what we've learned so far. What does generative AI primarily do? A, analyze data, B, generate new content, C, store data.
